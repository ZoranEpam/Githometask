Enter now the lions den
It's long past due that we begin
I have longed for you afar
Love sacrifice in my backyard
I have seen beyond my gaze
I have gazed beyond today
And their lust shall build a world
Is what the prophets have to say

In this world where I am king
The atoms roar and strange love sings
All the jewels that one can bring
Mutant rags and big T.V
Service now, the mushroom boy
Come to me now, by my side
And if it's you who want to play
Then I'm afraid you'll have to cry
